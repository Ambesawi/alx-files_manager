# Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Redis utils**
  + Inside the folder [`utils`](utils), create a file [`redis.js`](utils/redis.js) that contains the class `RedisClient`.
  + `RedisClient` should have:
    + The constructor that creates a client to Redis:
    + Any error of the redis client must be displayed in the console (you should use `on('error')` of the redis client).
    + A function `isAlive` that returns `true` when the connection to Redis is a success otherwise, `false`.
    + An asynchronous function `get` that takes a string key as argument and returns the Redis value stored for this key.
    + An asynchronous function `set` that takes a string key, a value and a duration in second as arguments to store it in Redis (with an expiration set by the duration argument).
    + An asynchronous function `del` that takes a string key as argument and remove the value in Redis for this key.
  + After the class definition, create and export an instance of `RedisClient` called `redisClient`.

+ [x] 1. **MongoDB utils**
  + Inside the folder [`utils`](utils), create a file [`db.js`](db.js) that contains the class `DBClient`.
  + `DBClient` should have:
    + The constructor that creates a client to MongoDB:
      + host: from the environment variable `DB_HOST` or default: `localhost`.
      + port: from the environment variable `DB_PORT` or default: `27017`.
      + database: from the environment variable `DB_DATABASE` or default: `files_manager`.
    + A function `isAlive` that returns `true` when the connection to MongoDB is a success otherwise, `false`.
    + An asynchronous function `nbUsers` that returns the number of documents in the collection `users`.
    + An asynchronous function `nbFiles` that returns the number of documents in the collection `files`.
  + After the class definition, create and export an instance of `DBClient` called `dbClient`.

+ [x] 2. **First API**
  + Inside [`server.js`](server.js), create the Express server:
    + It should listen on the port set by the environment variable `PORT` or by default 5000.
    + It should load all routes from the file [`routes/index.js`](routes/index.js).
  + Inside the folder [`routes`](routes), create a file [`index.js`](routes/index.js) that contains all endpoints of our API:
    + `GET /status` => `AppController.getStatus`.
    + `GET /stats` => `AppController.getStats`.
  + Inside the folder controllers, create a file AppController.js that contains the definition of the 2 endpoints:
    + `GET /status` should return if Redis is alive and if the DB is alive too by using the 2 utils created previously: `{ "redis": true, "db": true }` with a status code 200.
    + `GET /stats` should return the number of users and files in DB: `{ "users": 12, "files": 1231 }` with a status code 200.
      + `users` collection must be used for counting all users.
      + `files` collection must be used for counting all files.

+ [x] 3. **Create a new user**
  + Now that we have a simple API, it's time to add users to our database.
  + In the file [`routes/index.js`](routes/index.js), add a new endpoint:
    + `POST /users` => `UsersController.postNew`.
  + Inside [`controllers`](controllers), add a file [`UsersController.js`](UsersController.js) that contains the new endpoint:
    + `POST /users` should create a new user in DB:
      + To create a user, you must specify an `email` and a `password`.
      + If the `email` is missing, return an error `Missing email` with a status code 400.
      + If the `password` is missing, return an error `Missing password` with a status code 400.
      + If the `email` already exists in DB, return an error `Already exist` with a status code 400.
      + The error messages should be in a JSON object. For e.g.; `{"error":"Already exist"}`.
      + The `password` must be stored after being hashed in `SHA1`.
      + The endpoint is returning the new user with only the `email` and the `id` (auto generated by MongoDB) with a status code 201.
      + The new user must be saved in the collection `users`:
        + `email`: same as the value received.
        + `password`: `SHA1` value of the value received.

+ [x] 4. **Authenticate a user**
  + In the file [`routes/index.js`](routes/index.js), add 3 new endpoints:
    + `GET /connect` => `AuthController.getConnect`.
    + `GET /disconnect` => `AuthController.getDisconnect`.
    + `GET /users/me` => `UserController.getMe`.
  + Inside [`controllers`](controllers), add a file [`AuthController.js`](controllers/AuthController.js) that contains new endpoints:
    + `GET /connect` should sign-in the user by generating a new authentication token:
      + By using the header `Authorization` and the technique of the Basic auth (Base64 of the `<email>:<password>`), find the user associated to this email and with this password (reminder: we are storing the SHA1 of the password).
      + If no user has been found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401
      + Otherwise:
        + Generate a random string (using `uuidv4`) as token.
        + Create a key: `auth_<token>`.
        + Use this key for storing in Redis (by using the `redisClient` create previously) the user ID for 24 hours.
        + Return this token: Format: `{ "token": "155342df-2399-41da-9e8c-458b6ac52a0c" }` with a status code 200.
    + Now, we have a way to identify a user, create a token (= avoid to store the password on any front-end) and use this token for 24h to access to the API!
    + Every authenticated endpoints of our API will look at this token inside the header X-Token.
    + `GET /disconnect` should sign-out the user based on the token:
      + Retrieve the user based on the token:
        + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
        + Otherwise, delete the token in Redis and return nothing with a status code 204.
  + Inside the file [`controllers/UsersController.js`](controllers/UsersController.js) add a new endpoint:
  + `GET /users/me` should retrieve the user base on the token used:
    + Retrieve the user based on the token:
      + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
      + Otherwise, return the user object (`email` and `id` only).

+ [x] 5. **First file**
  + In the file routes/index.js, add a new endpoint:
    + `POST /files` => `FilesController.postUpload`.
  + Inside [`controllers`](controllers), add a file [`FilesController.js`](controllers/FilesController.js) that contains the new endpoint:
    + `POST /files` should create a new file in DB and in disk:
      + Retrieve the user based on the token:
        + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
      + To create a file, you must specify:
        + `name`: as filename.
        + `type`: either `folder`, `file` or `image`.
        + `parentId`: (optional) as ID of the parent (default: 0 -> the root).
        + `isPublic`: (optional) as boolean to define if the file is public or not (default: false).
        + `data`: (only for `type=file|image`) as Base64 of the file content.
      + If the `name` is missing, return an error `Missing name` with a status code 400.
      + If the `type` is missing or not part of the list of accepted type, return an error `Missing type` with a status code 400.
      + If the `data` is missing and `type != folder`, return an error `Missing data` with a status code 400.
      + If the `parentId` is set:
        + If no file is present in DB for this `parentId`, return an error `Parent not found` with a status code 400.
        + If the file present in DB for this `parentId` is not of type `folder`, return an error `Parent is not a folder` with a status code 400.
      + The user ID should be added to the document saved in DB - as owner of a file.
      + If the type is `folder`, add the new file document in the DB and return the new file with a status code 201.
      + Otherwise:
        + All file will be stored locally in a folder (to create automatically if not present):
          + The relative path of this folder is given by the environment variable `FOLDER_PATH`.
          + If this variable is not present or empty, use `/tmp/files_manager` as storing folder path.
        + Create a local path in the storing folder with filename a UUID.
        + Store the file in clear (reminder: `data` contains the Base64 of the file) in this local path.
        + Add the new file document in the collection `files` with these attributes:
          + `userId`: ID of the owner document (owner from the authentication).
          + `name`: same as the value received.
          + `type`: same as the value received.
          + `isPublic`: same as the value received.
          + `parentId`: same as the value received - if not present: 0.
          + `localPath`: for a `type=file|image`, the absolute path to the file save in local.
        + Return the new file with a status code 201.

+ [x] 6. **Get and list file**
  + In the file [`routes/index.js`](routes/index.js), add 2 new endpoints:
    + `GET /files/:id` => `FilesController.getShow`.
    + `GET /files` => `FilesController.getIndex`.
  + In the file [`controllers/FilesController.js`](controllers/FilesController.js), add the 2 new endpoints:
    + `GET /files/:id` should retrieve the file document based on the ID:
      + Retrieve the user based on the token:
        + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
      + If no file document is linked to the user and the ID passed as parameter, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.
      + Otherwise, return the file document.
    + `GET /files` should retrieve all users file documents for a specific `parentId` and with pagination:
      + Retrieve the user based on the token:
        + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
      + Based on the query parameters `parentId` and `page`, return the list of file document.
        + `parentId`:
          + No validation of `parentId` needed - if the `parentId` is not linked to any user folder, returns an empty list.
          + By default, `parentId` is equal to 0 = the root.
        + Pagination:
          + Each page should be 20 items max.
          + `page` query parameter starts at 0 for the first page. If equals to 1, it means it's the second page (from the 20th to the 40th), etc…
          + Pagination can be done directly by the `aggregate` of MongoDB.

+ [x] 7. **File publish/unpublish**
  + In the file [`routes/index.js`](routes/index.js), add 2 new endpoints:
    + `PUT /files/:id/publish` => `FilesController.putPublish`.
    + `PUT /files/:id/unpublish` => `FilesController.putUnpublish`.
  + In the file [`controllers/FilesController.js`](controllers/FilesController.js), add the 2 new endpoints:
    + `PUT /files/:id/publish` should set `isPublic` to `true` on the file document based on the ID:
      + Retrieve the user based on the token:
        + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
      + If no file document is linked to the user and the ID passed as parameter, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.
      + Otherwise:
        + Update the value of `isPublic` to `true`.
        + And return the file document with a status code 200.
    + `PUT /files/:id/unpublish` should set `isPublic` to `false` on the file document based on the ID:
      + Retrieve the user based on the token:
        + If not found, return an error `Unauthorized` with a status code 401.
      + If no file document is linked to the user and the ID passed as parameter, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.
      + Otherwise:
        + Update the value of `isPublic` to `false`.
        + And return the file document with a status code 200.

+ [x] 8. **File data**
  + In the file [`routes/index.js`](routes/index.js), add one new endpoint:
    + `GET /files/:id/data` => `FilesController.getFile`.
  + In the file [`controllers/FilesController.js`](controllers/FilesController.js), add the new endpoint:
    + `GET /files/:id/data` should return the content of the file document based on the ID:
      + If no file document is linked to the ID passed as parameter, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.
      + If the file document (folder or file) is not public (`isPublic: false`) and no user authenticate or not the owner of the file, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.
      + If the type of the file document is `folder`, return an error `A folder doesn't have content` with a status code 400.
      + If the file is not locally present, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.
      + Otherwise:
        + By using the module `mime-types`, get the [MIME-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) based on the `name` of the file.
        + Return the content of the file with the correct MIME-type.

+ [x] 9. **Image Thumbnails**
  + Update the endpoint `POST /files` endpoint to start a background processing for generating thumbnails for a file of type `image`:
    + Create a `Bull` queue `fileQueue`.
    + When a new image is stored (in local and in DB), add a job to this queue with the `userId` and `fileId`.
  + Create a file [`worker.js`](worker.js):
    + By using the module `Bull`, create a queue `fileQueue`.
    + Process this queue:
      + If `fileId` is not present in the job, raise an error `Missing fileId`.
      + If `userId is not present in the job, raise an error `Missing userId`.
      + If no document is found in DB based on the `fileId` and `userId`, raise an error `File not found`.
      + By using the module `image-thumbnail`, generate 3 thumbnails with `width` = 500, 250 and 100 - store each result on the same location of the original file by appending `_<width size>`.
  + Update the endpoint `GET /files/:id/data` to accept a query parameter `size`:
    + `size` can be `500`, `250` or `100`.
    + Based on `size`, return the correct local file.
    + If the local file doesn't exist, return an error `Not found` with a status code 404.

+ [x] 10. **Tests!**
  + Of course, a strong and stable project can not be good without tests.
  + Create tests for `redisClient` and `dbClient`.
  + Create tests for each endpoint:
    + `GET /status`
    + `GET /stats`
    + `POST /users`
    + `GET /connect`
    + `GET /disconnect`
    + `GET /users/me`
    + `POST /files`
    + `GET /files/:id`
    + `GET /files` (don't forget the pagination)
    + `PUT /files/:id/publish`
    + `PUT /files/:id/unpublish`
    + `GET /files/:id/data`

+ [x] 11. **New user - welcome email**
  + Update the endpoint `POST /users` endpoint to start a background processing for sending a “Welcome email” to the user:
    + Create a `Bull` queue `userQueue`.
    + When a new user is stored (in DB), add a job to this queue with the `userId`.
  + Update the file [worker.js](worker.js):
    + By using the module `Bull`, create a queue `userQueue`.
    + Process this queue:
      + If `userId` is not present in the job, raise an error `Missing userId`.
      + If no document is found in DB based on the userId, raise an error `User not found`.
      + Print in the console `Welcome <email>!`.
  + In real life, you can use a third party service like [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) to send real email. These API are slow, (sending via SMTP is worst!) and sending emails via a background job is important to optimize API endpoint.
